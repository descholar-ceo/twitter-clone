![Linters](https://github.com/descholar-ceo/twitter-clone/workflows/Linters/badge.svg)

## Project description
This project is for learning purpose just to get familiar with authentication with [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) in Ruby on Rails. It is gotten from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication).

In it, I built a simple Twitter clone demo, with ruby on rails, erb, and [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
